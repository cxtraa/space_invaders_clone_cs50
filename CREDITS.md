## Game fundamentals
I followed the tutorials on [Nick Tasios'](http://nicktasios.nl/) website. They can be found in his Blog section, with the title 'Space Invaders from Scratch'. This taught me the fundamentals of rendering with OpenGL, and how to implement the basics like player movement, and text rendering. All other elements of the program were entirely coded by me.

## Audio and soundtracks
SFX are from the [Woolyss](https://woolyss.com/chipmusic-samples.php) website. I used Atom Splitter volumes 1 & 2, as well as 'Sound of Arcade 8-bit Games'.

The title screen soundtrack is from K00sin's [Chiptune Grooving](https://pixabay.com/music/video-games-chiptune-grooving-142242/).

The in-game soundtrack is from [Filippo Vicarelli's](https://www.filippovicarelli.com/8bit-game-background-music) website. I used 'Commodore 64 Style - Battle Music Loop 02'.
