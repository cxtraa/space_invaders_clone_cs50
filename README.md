# Space Invaders clone in C++

## Introduction
This project is a clone of Space Invaders built in C++ using OpenGL for graphics rendering, and irrKlang for audio control. It is intended to be my CS50 final project. 

## Game description
The entire game is written in `main.cpp`, with around 1000 lines of code. I later realised very far in the game development process that this was probably a bad idea, because it became quite difficult to organise the code properly. I chose to write it in C++ because I enjoyed using C throughout the CS50 course, but wanted some extra functionality that C could not offer, such as classes, and a greater number of libraries available to download. I also used a small amount of the GLSL language, which is used to write fragment and vertex shaders for use in OpenGL. It is syntactically quite similar to C and allowed me to render sprites using a vertex array object.

Rendering using OpenGL was one of the most conceptually difficult parts of the game. To render sprites, I used OpenGL's graphics pipeline. This involved: creating a vertex shader (responsible for providing vertex coordinates - pixel colours between the vertices are then interpolated), creating a fragment shader (responsible for doing interpolation to find colour of a pixel, using a buffer which stores our pixel data), and then creating a VAO (vertex array object) to link the vertex data and the shader programs.
